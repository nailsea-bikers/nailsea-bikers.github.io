Due to Coronavirus, unfortunately we have decided to cancel the 2020 show. Please see a statement from our Chairman John Colley below.

Hi all

After much deliberation and consultation with the charity and the committee it is with a heavy heart that I have to announce that we have decided to cancel 2020’s Nailsea Bike show.

This is not a decision we have taken lightly but based on current rules and the possibility of a second spike it is impossible to predict if it will be legal, safe or even feasible to hold an event in September. We regret that this will be yet another revenue stream removed for the CHSW and we will try to think of ways we can still help them this year that may in part make up for the money that would have been generated by the show.

As always we really appreciate your support with our event and hope that most if not all of you will be available to perform at our show in 2021.

On a more positive note Let’s work together to make 2021’s Nailsea “International” Bike show the best event to date.

Thanks again to you all for your support to date and in the future.

Please stay safe in the meantime.

Yours Sincerely

John Colley

Chairman Nailsea Bikers
