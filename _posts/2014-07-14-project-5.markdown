description: Camping is available in a local field, but it should be stressed though that no facilities will be available on site. The site is suitable for tents and cars/camper vans/caravans. There is no charge for the use of the campsite over the bike show weekend. If you have any issues finding the site please speak to team members at the show, the location of the site is shown in the map above and there will be signs out on the day. If you wish to camp can we ask that you leave the site as you find it so that we retain the farmers good will for future shows.
