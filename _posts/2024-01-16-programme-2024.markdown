## Full Programme

After careful consideration we have made the decision not to run the 2024 Nailsea Bike Show.

We work hard to raise money for local charities by providing visitors with a weekend exhibition of motorcycles and live music, we realise this will be a disappointment to many of our loyal supporters.

Finding suitable facilities to run an event of this size is difficult and we continue to face a number of challenges with the coordination of our show, but our enthusiasm continues and we will be back again in early September 2025.
