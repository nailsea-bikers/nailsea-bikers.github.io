description2: We are always looking for people to bring bikes to display at the show. If you have an old, interesting or unusual bike you wish to display then we would be delighted to have it. We have paid overnight security if you wished to leave it with us all weekend but we simply ask you to be with us by 10:30 am on either day to have it in position by 11am. Display bikes can be picked up from 5pm on either day but if earlier talk to one of our team and they will walk you out to ensure you can exit the show ground safely. Awards will be presented at around 4:30pm on the Sunday. You do not have to book a space but please feel free to contact us via Facebook or email is you have any further questions.
