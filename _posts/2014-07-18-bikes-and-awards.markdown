Anything with two wheels is welcome at our show. <br/><br/>As we have in previous years we will be holding a competition for the best bike in show and also we will be presenting the annual ‘Cecil Keel Award’ for the best classic British bike. memory of Cecil Keel (16th April 1926 – 5th October 2015), Cecil had a passion for motorcycles from his teenage years and in particular had a keen interest in Velocette’s. He started collecting motorcycles in the 1980’s and was actively involved in the Vintage Motorcycle Club and Velocette Owners Club.

description2: We are always looking for people to bring bikes to display at the show. If you own a bike or bikes and are interested in displaying them please get in touch via our contacts page and our show organisers will be happy to provide you with more information and coordinate things with you. We always employ professional overnight security at our show as many people who kindly allow us to show their bikes can be confident we take the best possible care of their prized possessions. We also aim to keep all bikes under cover at the request of owners should the weather take a turn for the worse.
