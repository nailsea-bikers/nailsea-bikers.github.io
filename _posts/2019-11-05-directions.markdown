description: Directions to the Nailsea Bike Show

---

The Nailsea Bike show is held at The Ring O Bells pub, Nailsea- <a href="https://goo.gl/maps/W6MeZ2wZbGC2" target="_blank">Google Maps</a>

Follow the brown signs to "Tithe Barn" and it will take you directly to the show.  There will also be bike show signs at key junctions.

On arrival to the show you will be directed by a team member to a suitable parking area.

As the show is being held in a residential area we ask all our visitors to be respectful of our neighbours when arriving and leaving the venue.
