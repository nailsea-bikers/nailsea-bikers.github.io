Nailsea Bikers
====================

Nailsea Bikers was formed by a small group friends and bike enthusiasts in Nailsea, near Bristol who had a passion for their bikes and wanted to share this by displaying their machines at a local pub in Nailsea.

This is now the 10th year we will be holding the ‘Nailsea International Bike Show’ with the show having grown in size and interest over successive years attracting motorcycle enthusiasts from far and wide. It still holds true to it’s core values as being a family friendly local bikes show.

The ‘Nailsea International Bike Show’ is free show open to everyone.

We also place a lot of importance on raising money for local charities and again this year we will be looking to support the Children’s Hospice South West. A charity that works to provide hospice care for children with life-limiting conditions and their whole family across the South West.

As motorcycle enthusiasts we do more than just organise the annual bike show. We hold regular social events and ride outs.
